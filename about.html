          <p >It is my favorite hotel among Alanya center hotels. I did not have any problems despite my long stay for business. Although its dishes start to repeat itself after a while, it is quite suitable in terms of cleanliness and taste. Being on the Cleopatra beach is another beautiful thing.</p>
